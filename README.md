# Sky_DSnA
I actually completed this entire class at the start of this year (2021) after completing the DS&A course from NPTEL.
The code was quite lengthy, around 500-600 lines, with many algorithms and helpful functions that were working perfectly. 
However, I lost all my progress when my system crashed and unfortunately, I didn't keep a backup of my scripts anywhere.
Now I have started working on it again, from the scratch, and this time I will be keeping a backup of every single code/change/script/module. :)
