# Sky_DSnA
This project includes custom generic classes that can be imported for different data types such as 1D arrays, 2D arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.  
Many recognized algorithms in DSA are also included in the classes for each data type.  
I actually completed this entire class at the start of this year (2021) after completing the DS&A course from NPTEL.  
The code was quite lengthy, around 500-600 lines, with many algorithms and helpful functions that were working perfectly.   
However, I lost all my progress (other projects as well) when my system crashed and unfortunately, I didn't keep a backup of my scripts anywhere.  
Now I have started working on it again, from the scratch, and this time I will be keeping a backup of every single code/change/script/module. :)
